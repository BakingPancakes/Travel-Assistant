- Team 8: Travel Coordinator
  
- Description:
    - Problem: Group trips are notoriously hard to plan and coordinate. Keeping track of all the tasks that need to be completed can be incredibly challenging to do across instant messaging.
    - Solution: The travel coordinator aids in planning both solo and group trips by providing a platform to keep all your information in one place: dates, locations, budgets, and itineraries can all be viewed and adjusted here.
    
- Key Features:
    - Task List: a to-do-list-like feature to assist individuals in planning what tasks need to be done before, during, or after the trip. Optionally adding a modifiable packing list.
    - Messaging between group members.
    - Budgeting features: Group members can include fees for travel, food, fun, etc.
    - Itinerary: Group members can add events/activities they are interested in or intend on participating in, including when, where, what it is, and optional costs.

- Why This Project?
    - Miscommunication among group members can lead to distress, confusion, or financial issues if plans don't go right. A consolidated location for all aspects of a trip can help save time, money, and additional unnecessary distress.
    - This project will align with coursework in web development and UI/UX applications.
    - Features in this project will involve user authentication, persistent storage, and user interaction.
